# Design decisions

**stdout is the JSON-RPC wire.** All logging is forced to stderr. A single stray
`Console.WriteLine` corrupts the protocol stream and the client dies with a
confusing parse error. This is the most common way to break an stdio MCP server.

**Down-level servers still exist.** The official Node filesystem server does not
implement the 2026-07-28 discovery flow; you'll see a benign
`server/discover: Method not found` on stderr as the SDK falls back to the older
`initialize` handshake. Supporting both eras is a real requirement, not a wart —
see [protocol compatibility](protocol-compatibility.md).

**`McpClientTool.WithName()` is a trap for proxies.** It renames the client-side
wrapper but not the underlying `ProtocolTool`, so `tools/list` advertises the old
name while `tools/call` expects the new one. `ToolNamespacer.Qualify(string, Tool)`
copies the DTO properly; there's a regression test pinning it.

**Audit backpressure is deliberate.** The sink hands records to a bounded channel
so tool calls never wait on disk, but when that buffer fills producers *wait*
rather than drop. For a security tool, "no record exists" and "nothing happened"
must not be indistinguishable. Dropping would keep the agent fast at the cost of
losing evidence; that is the wrong trade here.

**Audit is the outermost filter.** Filters nest like onion layers and the first
registered is the outermost, so audit wraps everything. That ordering is what lets
it record calls that policy, budget or approval later reject.

**The result scanner is the innermost filter**, for the mirror-image reason. It
must see what a downstream server actually returned, and must *not* see the
refusals the gates above it produce — those are the proxy's own words, and a
denial that quoted an injection back at the model would end up annotating its own
warning.

**AsyncLocal flows down, never up.** The audit filter is outermost but the
decision it logs is made by the policy filter inside it. An inner filter
reassigning an `AsyncLocal` would be invisible to the outer one, so
`GuardrailsCallScope` publishes a mutable holder that inner filters *mutate*
instead.

**The glob and JSONPath evaluators are hand-rolled, and that is the point.** A
policy file is configuration, and both a regex compiled from configuration and a
reflection-based JSONPath library are liabilities here — the first can backtrack
catastrophically and hang every tool call, the second breaks under Native AOT.
The glob matcher is a two-pointer scan with one backtrack point, the path
resolver walks spans without allocating, and the one place a real regex is
exposed to policy input (`matches:`) runs under a 100 ms timeout.

**Policy loading avoids reflection on purpose.** YamlDotNet's `Deserializer`
binds via reflection, which Native AOT trims — it would yield a policy with no
rules, silently allowing everything. So YAML is parsed to a `JsonNode` tree and
bound by the source-generated deserializer instead.

**Two fail-open bugs, both caught by tests.** Property initializers are ignored
by source-generated deserialization, so an omitted `decision:` arrived as
`Verdict.Allow` (the enum's zero value) — a blocking rule would have permitted.
And `File.Exists()` returns false for a *directory*, so a policy path pointing at
one fell through to "no policy". A security component has to fail closed; both
now do, with regression tests.
