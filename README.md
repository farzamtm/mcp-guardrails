# MCP Guardrails Proxy

A policy-enforcing proxy that sits between an MCP client (Claude Desktop, an
agent framework) and the MCP servers it calls, so you can see and control what
your agent actually does.

> **Status: early.** Steps 0-3 of the build plan are done: the proxy connects to
> downstream servers, aggregates their tools under a namespace, and forwards
> calls. The guardrails themselves (policy, budgets, approval, redaction) are
> next. See [the spec](mcp-guardrails-dotnet-spec.md).

## What works today

- Spawns and connects to downstream stdio MCP servers
- Aggregates `tools/list` across servers, namespaced as `<server>__<tool>`
- Routes `tools/call` to the owning server and forwards the result
- Unknown tools return a *tool error*, not a protocol error, so the model can react

## Quickstart

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test

# See what the proxy discovered downstream
./src/McpGuardrails.Cli/bin/Debug/net10.0/McpGuardrails.Cli list-upstream

# Drive the full chain without a real client
python3 scripts/smoke.py
```

Expected:

```text
PASS  proxy advertises namespaced downstream tools
PASS  write_file forwarded downstream
PASS  read_text_file returns what we wrote
PASS  unknown tool -> tool error, not a protocol error

ALL OK
```

To use it from Claude Desktop, see [`examples/claude-desktop-config.json`](examples/claude-desktop-config.json).

## How it works

The proxy is two things at once:

```text
Claude Desktop  ──thinks it's talking to a server──►  GUARDRAILS  ──thinks it's a client──►  filesystem server
                                                          │                                  (more servers…)
                                                          └── audit / policy / approval
```

- **Server half** — `src/McpGuardrails.Cli/Program.cs` registers `WithListToolsHandler`
  and `WithCallToolHandler` instead of tools of its own.
- **Client half** — `src/McpGuardrails.Core/Upstream/UpstreamRegistry.cs` owns one
  `McpClient` per downstream server and resolves a qualified tool name to its owner.

Every guardrail in the spec becomes a filter wrapped around the call handler, using
the SDK's `McpServerFilters.Request.CallToolFilters` pipeline.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/McpGuardrails.Core/Upstream/` | Downstream connections, tool namespacing |
| `src/McpGuardrails.Cli/Program.cs` | Host wiring; the server half of the proxy |
| `tests/McpGuardrails.Core.Tests/` | xUnit tests for the pure logic |
| `scripts/smoke.py` | Dependency-free MCP driver for end-to-end checks |

## Notes for the curious

**stdout is the JSON-RPC wire.** All logging is forced to stderr. A single stray
`Console.WriteLine` corrupts the protocol stream and the client dies with a
confusing parse error. This is the most common way to break an stdio MCP server.

**Down-level servers still exist.** The official Node filesystem server does not
implement the 2026-07-28 discovery flow; you'll see a benign
`server/discover: Method not found` on stderr as the SDK falls back to the older
`initialize` handshake. Supporting both eras is a real requirement, not a wart.

**`McpClientTool.WithName()` is a trap for proxies.** It renames the client-side
wrapper but not the underlying `ProtocolTool`, so `tools/list` advertises the old
name while `tools/call` expects the new one. `ToolNamespacer.Qualify(string, Tool)`
copies the DTO properly; there's a regression test pinning it.

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js (only to run the downstream filesystem server via `npx`)
- Python 3 (only for `scripts/smoke.py`)
