# MCP Guardrails Proxy

A policy-enforcing proxy that sits between an MCP client (Claude Desktop, an
agent framework) and the MCP servers it calls, so you can see and control what
your agent actually does.

> **Status: early.** Steps 0-4 of the build plan are done: the proxy connects to
> downstream servers, aggregates their tools under a namespace, forwards calls,
> and audits every one of them. Policy, budgets, approval and redaction are next.
> See [the spec](mcp-guardrails-dotnet-spec.md).

## What works today

- Spawns and connects to downstream stdio MCP servers
- Aggregates `tools/list` across servers, namespaced as `<server>__<tool>`
- Routes `tools/call` to the owning server and forwards the result
- Unknown tools return a *tool error*, not a protocol error, so the model can react
- **Audits every call** to a JSONL log, including calls the proxy rejects

## The audit log

With no policy configured the proxy is a pure passthrough that tells you what your
agent is doing. That is the whole point of transparent-by-default: useful before
you write a single rule.

Default location `~/.mcp-guardrails/audit.jsonl`, overridable with `GUARDRAILS_AUDIT`.

```json
{"ts":"2026-09-07T07:19:30.894358+00:00","event":"tool_call","tool":"fs__write_file",
 "server":"fs","downstream_tool":"write_file",
 "arguments":{"path":"/tmp/guardrails-sandbox/probe.txt","content":"..."},
 "duration_ms":5.87,"is_error":false}
```

```bash
# What did my agent touch, and how long did it take?
jq -r '[.ts, .tool, (.duration_ms|tostring)] | @tsv' ~/.mcp-guardrails/audit.jsonl

# Only the failures
jq 'select(.is_error)' ~/.mcp-guardrails/audit.jsonl
```

## Quickstart

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test

# See what the proxy discovered downstream
./src/McpGuardrails.Cli/bin/Debug/net10.0/McpGuardrails.Cli list-upstream

# Drive the full chain without a real client
python3 scripts/smoke.py
```

Expected:

```text
PASS  proxy advertises namespaced downstream tools
PASS  write_file forwarded downstream
PASS  read_text_file returns what we wrote
PASS  unknown tool -> tool error, not a protocol error

ALL OK
```

To use it from Claude Desktop, see [`examples/claude-desktop-config.json`](examples/claude-desktop-config.json).

## How it works

The proxy is two things at once:

```text
Claude Desktop  ──thinks it's talking to a server──►  GUARDRAILS  ──thinks it's a client──►  filesystem server
                                                          │                                  (more servers…)
                                                          └── audit / policy / approval
```

- **Server half** — `src/McpGuardrails.Cli/Program.cs` registers `WithListToolsHandler`
  and `WithCallToolHandler` instead of tools of its own.
- **Client half** — `src/McpGuardrails.Core/Upstream/UpstreamRegistry.cs` owns one
  `McpClient` per downstream server and resolves a qualified tool name to its owner.

Every guardrail in the spec becomes a filter wrapped around the call handler, using
the SDK's `McpServerFilters.Request.CallToolFilters` pipeline.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/McpGuardrails.Core/Upstream/` | Downstream connections, tool namespacing |
| `src/McpGuardrails.Core/Audit/` | Audit record + channel-backed JSONL sink |
| `src/McpGuardrails.Core/Serialization/` | Source-generated JSON (AOT-safe) |
| `src/McpGuardrails.Cli/Program.cs` | Host wiring; the server half of the proxy |
| `tests/McpGuardrails.Core.Tests/` | xUnit tests for the pure logic |
| `scripts/smoke.py` | Dependency-free MCP driver for end-to-end checks |

## Notes for the curious

**stdout is the JSON-RPC wire.** All logging is forced to stderr. A single stray
`Console.WriteLine` corrupts the protocol stream and the client dies with a
confusing parse error. This is the most common way to break an stdio MCP server.

**Down-level servers still exist.** The official Node filesystem server does not
implement the 2026-07-28 discovery flow; you'll see a benign
`server/discover: Method not found` on stderr as the SDK falls back to the older
`initialize` handshake. Supporting both eras is a real requirement, not a wart.

**`McpClientTool.WithName()` is a trap for proxies.** It renames the client-side
wrapper but not the underlying `ProtocolTool`, so `tools/list` advertises the old
name while `tools/call` expects the new one. `ToolNamespacer.Qualify(string, Tool)`
copies the DTO properly; there's a regression test pinning it.

**Audit backpressure is deliberate.** The sink hands records to a bounded channel
so tool calls never wait on disk, but when that buffer fills producers *wait*
rather than drop. For a security tool, "no record exists" and "nothing happened"
must not be indistinguishable. Dropping would keep the agent fast at the cost of
losing evidence; that is the wrong trade here.

**Audit is the outermost filter.** Filters nest like onion layers and the first
registered is the outermost, so audit wraps everything. That ordering is what lets
it record calls that policy, budget or approval later reject.

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js (only to run the downstream filesystem server via `npx`)
- Python 3 (only for `scripts/smoke.py`)
